# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Code is the plan — developers build first and extract structured planning from annotated code
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — annotation-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-03-28

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Fork rather than PR upstream (fundamentally different workflow philosophy)
- Initialization: Regex-based tag extraction (simpler than AST, language-agnostic)
- Initialization: Preserve all original commands (users can mix code-first and plan-first per phase)
- Research: gsd-executor modification to be implemented as new gsd-arc-executor.md wrapper, not a patch to upstream file
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: Exported buildNewProjectConfig() for programmatic config access by Phase 2 agents
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: arc.enabled/tag_prefix/comment_anchors and phase_modes/default_phase_mode added as ADDITIVE config extension
- [Phase 01]: Tag names are frozen as of v1.0 — 8 @gsd-tag types will not be renamed (arc-standard.md)
- [Phase 01]: Comment anchor rule: @gsd-tags only valid when comment token is first non-whitespace content on the line
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: gsd-annotator reads arc-standard.md, PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md before annotating (D-13)
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: annotate command auto-chains to extract-plan via gsd-tools.cjs extract-tags on completion (D-12)
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: gsd-annotator hard constraint: never modify code logic, function signatures, or existing comments
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: Used new RegExp(TAG_LINE_RE.source, 'gm') per scanFile call to avoid lastIndex state bugs with /gm flag
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: VALID_TAG_TYPES Set guard drops unknown tag type names — prevents typos leaking into CODE-INVENTORY.md
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: Inline trailing comment false positive (const x = 1; // @gsd-context ...) excluded by TAG_LINE_RE ^[\t]* anchor — correct per ARC Comment Anchor Rule
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: Used parseNamedArgs() helper for extract-tags flag parsing to match the style of all other case branches
- [Phase 01-annotation-foundation]: gsd:extract-plan slash command writes to .planning/prototype/CODE-INVENTORY.md per Decision D-09

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 (gsd-code-planner): HIGH risk agent — prompt structure for reliable PLAN.md from CODE-INVENTORY.md is not fully resolved. Consider /gsd:research-phase before planning Phase 2.
- Phase 1: ARC tag standard must be treated as versioned from day one. Run at least one real annotation session before freezing the spec.
