# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Code is the plan -- developers build first and extract structured planning from annotated code
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — arc-as-default

## Current Position

Phase: 6
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-03-29

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research: /gsd:review-code chosen as command name (not /gsd:review) -- avoids collision with existing review.md command (Pitfall 15)
- Research: PRD ingestion belongs in command orchestrator, not in gsd-prototyper agent -- keeps agent prompt stable across PRD formats
- Research: Test execution belongs in /gsd:review-code command layer, not inside gsd-tester -- prevents context window blockage on long test suites
- Research: arc.enabled defaults to true via config.arc?.enabled ?? true -- new installs get true, explicit false configs are preserved unchanged
- Research: REVIEW-CODE.md (not REVIEW.md or REVIEWS.md) is the hard-constraint output file name for review artifacts
- [Phase 05]: ARC_ENABLED fallback changed from false to true in all three agent/command files — fresh installs without config.json default to ARC on (ARC-01)
- [Phase 05]: iterate.md step 4 now uses bash variable with fallback and logs executor selection; config.cjs left untouched (D-01)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 (PRD pipeline): PRD requirements extraction approach needs a concrete agent prompt validated against at least 2-3 real PRD formats before command is written. Run /gsd:research-phase before planning.
- Phase 7 (gsd-tester): RED-GREEN discipline requires a concrete definition of "stub implementation" that the agent can detect. Must be in agent prompt before implementation.
- Phase 8 (review command): Two-stage Reviewer + Judge pattern needs an explicit Judge prompt design before Phase 8 begins. This is the highest-complexity design task in v1.1.
