# GSD Code-First Fork

## What This Is

A fork of the GSD (Get Shit Done) framework that implements the "Code-First" principle. Instead of running discuss -> plan -> execute for every phase, developers build a prototype directly, annotate the code with structured @gsd-tags (the "ARC" system), and use those annotations as planning input for further iterations. Installable as `npx gsd-code-first@latest`.

Shipped v1.0 with 4 new agents, 6 new commands, ARC annotation standard, and full documentation.

## Core Value

Code is the plan -- developers build first and extract structured planning from annotated code, eliminating the overhead of upfront document-heavy planning while maintaining traceability.

## Requirements

### Active

#### Current Milestone: v1.1 Autonomous Prototype & Review Loop

**Goal:** Make the code-first workflow the standard routine -- PRD in, functional prototype out, with review and verification.

**Target features:**
- PRD-to-Prototype Pipeline (`/gsd:prototype` overhaul)
- ARC as default (`arc.enabled` always `true`)
- Test-Agent (new agent for writing unit/integration tests)
- Review-Agent + `/gsd:review` command (test execution, evaluation, manual verification, next steps)

### Out of Scope

- UI/Frontend -- this is a CLI tool, no visual interface
- Breaking changes to original GSD commands -- existing workflows must still function
- Custom editor integrations -- IDE plugins are out of scope for v1
- Multi-language AST parsing for tags -- regex-based extraction is sufficient for v1
- ARC wrapper routing in traditional workflows -- wrapper agents only reachable via /gsd:iterate (documented limitation, tracked for v1.1)

## Context

- Shipped v1.0 on 2026-03-28 with 4 phases, 13 plans, 18 tasks
- Tech stack: JavaScript/Node.js (CJS), Markdown agents/commands, JSON config
- Zero runtime dependencies -- all tooling uses Node.js built-ins
- 4 new agents: gsd-prototyper, gsd-code-planner, gsd-arc-executor, gsd-arc-planner
- 6 new commands: prototype, iterate, annotate, extract-plan, set-mode, deep-plan
- All original GSD commands continue working unchanged
- 106 agent-frontmatter tests pass, 21 arc-scanner tests pass

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: JavaScript/Node.js, Markdown, JSON -- must match original GSD stack
- **Compatibility**: All original GSD commands must continue working unchanged
- **Distribution**: Must be installable via `npx gsd-code-first@latest`
- **Upstream mergeability**: Primarily additive changes to minimize merge conflicts with upstream
- **Zero runtime deps**: No external npm packages at runtime

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Fork rather than PR upstream | Fundamentally different workflow philosophy (code-first vs plan-first) | ✓ Good -- clean separation, no upstream conflicts |
| Regex-based tag extraction | Simpler than AST parsing, language-agnostic, sufficient for structured comments | ✓ Good -- handles all test cases, zero false positives |
| ARC annotation standard | Structured @gsd-tags provide machine-readable planning data embedded in code | ✓ Good -- 8 tag types frozen at v1.0, stable spec |
| Preserve all original commands | Users can mix code-first and plan-first workflows per phase | ✓ Good -- zero regressions in original functionality |
| Wrapper agents over patches | New gsd-arc-executor/planner files instead of modifying upstream agents | ✓ Good -- upstream files untouched, merge-safe |
| Comment anchor rule | @gsd-tags only valid on dedicated comment lines, not trailing comments | ✓ Good -- eliminates false positives in strings/URLs |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? -> Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? -> Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? -> Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? -> Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? -> Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check -- still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope -- reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
